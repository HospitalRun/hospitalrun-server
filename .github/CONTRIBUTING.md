# Contributing

HospitalRun is a community project. We invite your participation through
financial contributions, issues, and pull requests!

Contributions are always welcome. Before contributing please read the [code of conduct](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and
[search the issue tracker](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-server/issues); your issue
may have already been discussed or fixed in `master`. If you're new to the project,
maybe you'd like to open a pull request to address one of [good-first-issue](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

To contribute,
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo, commit your changes, and [send a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## Working on an Issue
In order to optimize the workflow and to prevent multiple contributors working on the same issue without interactions, a contributor must ask to be assigned to an issue by one of the core team members: it's enough to ask it inside the specific issue.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests should be submitted in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-server/issues), with a description of
the expected behavior & use case, where they’ll remain closed until sufficient interest,
[e.g. :+1: reactions](https://help.github.com/articles/about-discussions-in-issues-and-pull-requests/),
has been [shown by the community](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-server/issues?q=label%3A%22votes+needed%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).
Before submitting a request, please search for similar ones in the
[closed issues](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aenhancement).

## Pull Requests

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
